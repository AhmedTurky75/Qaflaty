- Professional: 10% (500 customers × $660 = $330K)

## CONCLUSION

Wuilt has created a compelling, market-leading position in the Egyptian e-commerce platform space through:
- An unbeatable free offering
- Superior localization for Arabic-speaking merchants  
- Excellent customer satisfaction
- Strong product-market fit

**However, significant opportunities exist** for a competing platform that:
- Targets growing merchants (those outgrowing Wuilt's free offering)
- Provides advanced features (automation, analytics, integrations)
- Maintains local Egyptian support and payment integration
- Focuses on merchant success and growth enablement
- Builds a strong ecosystem of integrations

**The market is large enough for multiple winners.** Success will depend on excellent execution in localization, product quality, customer support, and community building—not price competition.
